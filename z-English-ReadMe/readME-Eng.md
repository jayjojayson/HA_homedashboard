Homedashboard Cards and Layout Code for Home Assistant

Here I would like to introduce you [my dashboard](https://github.com/jayjojayson/HA_homedashboard) and provide you with a detailed overview. The dashboard is based on the new tile design in HA. The structure of the dashboard has grown a lot since then and an overview is good for me, too. The dashboard is adapted for tablet view. If possible, you shouldn't have to scroll, but in some places it just can't be avoided. In addition, the larger cards are broken up in the layout on the mobile phone and are therefore also displayed quite well. Development is continuing and I will try to maintain the current status of the dashboard at github. I will record current updates [here](https://github.com/jayjojayson/HA_homedashboard#%EF%B8%8F-updates).

## 📂 Folder Structure

Everything is clearly structured so that you can easily copy the elements you want. All YAML files are listed for each card and assigned to the corresponding pages or subpages. It's best to look at the respective screenshot of the page in the folder/subfolder and you can quickly assign the corresponding card or find it in the folder structure. You will also find the YAML for all the pages there. It is all in German, but the folder structure and pictures should be enough to find everything.
